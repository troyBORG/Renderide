//! Per-frame pipeline that turns host scene state into a render-graph submit.
//!
//! - [`render`] -- mode dispatch (desktop / VR / VR-secondaries-only) and MSAA prep.
//! - [`schedule`] -- explicit CPU render schedule phases shared by main and offscreen graph submissions.
//! - [`view_planning`] -- collects the HMD, secondary render-texture, and main swapchain views for one tick.
//! - [`view_plan`] -- per-view CPU intent types (target, clear, viewport, host camera).
//! - [`extract`] -- immutable per-tick view extraction, draw collection, and submit packet construction.
//! - [`submit`] -- runtime-side application of host frame-submit payloads.
