//! [`PostProcessEffect`] trait and identity enum used by [`super::PostProcessChain`].
//!
//! Effects read one HDR float texture and write another, but are free to register an arbitrary
//! subgraph in between (a single raster pass, a compute -> raster pair, a bloom mip-chain ladder,
//! etc.). They are added to the chain in execution order; each enabled effect's terminal pass
//! hands its output to the next effect (or to [`crate::passes::SceneColorComposePass`]
//! for the final one).
