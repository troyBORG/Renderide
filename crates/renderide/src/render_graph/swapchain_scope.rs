//! RAII guard for the swapchain surface texture acquired at the start of a multi-view frame.
//!
//! ## Safety contract
//!
//! wgpu's Vulkan backend ties a per-frame acquire semaphore to the [`wgpu::SurfaceTexture`].
//! The texture **must** be presented -- via [`wgpu::SurfaceTexture::present`] -- regardless of
//! whether the frame completes successfully, returns an error, or panics, so the semaphore and
//! image return to the swapchain pool. Failing to present causes a secondary panic
//! (`SwapchainAcquireSemaphore` still in use) that masks the original failure.
//!
//! [`SwapchainScope`] owns the surface texture and calls `present()` in its [`Drop`]
//! implementation, providing the guarantee unconditionally. This replaces the tuple-field
//! drop-order trick that was previously inlined in
//! `crates/renderide/src/render_graph/compiled/exec.rs`.
