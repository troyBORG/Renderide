//! Instance grouping for world-mesh forward draws.
//!
//! Produces an [`InstancePlan`] that groups `(batch_key, mesh, submesh)` runs into a
//! contiguous per-draw-slab range regardless of where the sort placed individual members.
//! The forward pass packs the per-draw slab in `slab_layout` order and emits one
//! `draw_indexed(.., 0, instance_range)` per [`DrawGroup`].
//!
//! Replaces the older `(regular_indices, intersect_indices) + for_each_instance_batch`
//! pipeline whose merge requirement was *adjacency in the sorted draw array* -- that policy
//! silently fragmented instancing whenever the sort cascade interleaved same-mesh draws
//! with different-mesh draws (e.g. varying `sorting_order` within one material).
