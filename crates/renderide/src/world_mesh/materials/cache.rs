//! Persistent cache of material-derived batch key fields, keyed by
//! `(material_asset_id, property_block_id)`.
//!
//! All values in [`ResolvedMaterialBatch`] are pure functions of
//! `(material_asset_id, property_block_id, shader_perm)` plus the current router state and
//! material/property-block property-store state. Caching them amortises repeated dictionary and
//! router lookups across all draws that share the same material: in a typical scene, hundreds of
//! draws share a few dozen materials.
//!
//! Unlike the previous per-frame rebuild, this cache lives across frames on [`RenderBackend`] and
//! invalidates individual entries via monotonic generation counters maintained by
//! [`crate::materials::host_data::MaterialPropertyStore`] and [`crate::materials::MaterialRouter`].
//! A frame where nothing has changed touches each live entry with one HashMap probe and four
//! `u64` comparisons -- no dictionary or router lookups required.
