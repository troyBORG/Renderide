//! Reusable lifecycle helpers for backend-owned nonblocking GPU jobs.
//!
//! These helpers are for one-off backend compute or copy work that needs completion
//! notification or a CPU readback outside the render graph. Frame-shape render work stays in
//! the graph so transient resources, barriers, and pass ordering remain explicit there.
