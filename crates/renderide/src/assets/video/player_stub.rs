//! Stub [`VideoPlayer`] used when the `video-textures` feature is disabled.
//!
//! Mirrors the public surface of the real GStreamer-backed player so that
//! upload handlers compile unchanged. Every method is a no-op; `new` always returns
//! `None`, so `video_players` stays empty and the integrator's polling loop
//! has nothing to drive.
