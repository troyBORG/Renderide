//! Dedicated GPU-submission thread.
//!
//! The main tick records command buffers, assembles a [`SubmitBatch`], and hands it to
//! [`DriverThread::submit`]. The driver thread drains a bounded FIFO ring
//! ([`ring::BoundedRing`]) and runs `Queue::submit` + `SurfaceTexture::present` off the
//! main thread. The ring's fixed capacity enforces at most one frame of pipelining
//! (backpressure when the driver falls behind).
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! The ring is FIFO and processed by a single thread, so GPU submit order matches the
//! order the main thread pushed. For one thread producing, one thread consuming, with
//! sequential in-order processing, nothing else is required.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! [`DriverThread`]'s `Drop` impl pushes a [`submit_batch::DriverMessage::Shutdown`]
//! sentinel and joins the thread. Any batches queued after shutdown will never run, but
//! in practice no caller pushes during shutdown because the renderer's frame loop has
//! already exited by the time [`crate::gpu::GpuContext`] drops.
