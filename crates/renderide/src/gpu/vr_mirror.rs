//! VR desktop mirror: copy one HMD eye into a staging texture, then blit to the window surface.
//!
//! The surface blit uses **cover** (fill) mapping: the window is filled with a uniform scale of the
//! staging texture; aspect mismatch is resolved by cropping the center (no letterboxing).
//!
//! Used instead of a second full world render when OpenXR multiview has already drawn the scene.
//!
//! When stereo MSAA is active ([`crate::gpu::GpuContext::swapchain_msaa_effective_stereo`] > 1) the
//! forward pass resolves into the single-sample OpenXR swapchain image, so this mirror always samples
//! already-resolved color and does not need to be aware of the sample count.
