//! Producer/consumer counters for surface-texture pipelining.
//!
//! The renderer relies on wgpu's invariant that only one [`wgpu::SurfaceTexture`] may be
//! outstanding at a time: the previous frame's [`wgpu::SurfaceTexture::present`] must run
//! before the next [`wgpu::Surface::get_current_texture`]. Phase 2 moved `present()` to
//! the driver thread, so the main thread needs a fine-grained wait -- not a full FIFO flush --
//! to block only on the specific event "previous surface texture has been presented".
//!
//! This module provides that primitive: [`SurfaceCounters`] tracks the number of
//! surface-carrying batches submitted by the main thread and the number actually presented
//! by the driver thread, plus a [`Condvar`] signaled on each present so the main thread
//! wakes as soon as the gap closes.
