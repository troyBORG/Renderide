//! OpenXR frame-finalize work piggybacked onto the driver thread.
//!
//! The main thread cannot release the OpenXR swapchain image and call `xrEndFrame` until
//! the previous `wgpu::Queue::submit` for the swapchain-touching work has hit the queue.
//! Doing the wait synchronously on the main thread defeats the driver-thread pipelining.
//! Instead the main thread packages everything `xrReleaseSwapchainImage` and
//! `xrEndFrame` need into [`XrFinalizeWork`] and attaches it to the trailing
//! [`super::SubmitBatch`] of the VR tick. The driver runs the finalize on its own
//! thread, then signals back via [`XrFinalizeSignal`] so the next tick's `wait_frame`
//! can synchronise with `xrBeginFrame` ordering.
//!
//! Errors observed on the driver thread are stored in a shared slot and surfaced to the
//! main thread on the next finalize wait so existing recovery paths react one tick later.
