//! [`GpuContext`]: instance, surface, device, and swapchain state.
//!
//! The struct lives here together with [`GpuError`] and the small core accessors
//! (`limits`, `device`, `queue`, `gpu_queue_access_gate`, `adapter_info`). All other
//! inherent methods are split across thematic submodules:
//!
//! - [`init`] -- three constructors (windowed, headless, OpenXR-bootstrap) + assemble helpers.
//! - [`surface`] -- present mode / max latency / resize / acquire-with-recovery.
//! - [`depth_attachment`] -- main forward depth target ensure/recreate.
//! - [`headless_targets`] -- [`headless_targets::PrimaryOffscreenTargets`] state and accessors.
//! - [`submission`] -- driver-thread submit / present facade.
//! - [`profiler`] -- frame-timing + GPU profiler facade and HUD-facing readouts.
//! - [`msaa`] -- [`GpuMsaa`] sub-handle for supported / effective MSAA tier state.
//! - [`mapped_buffer_recovery`] -- mapped staging/readback buffer recovery.
