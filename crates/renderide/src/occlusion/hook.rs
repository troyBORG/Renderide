//! Render-graph-facing trait implemented by the occlusion subsystem.
//!
//! Render-graph code and graph-driven passes interact with occlusion through this trait so they
//! depend on a thin contract rather than the concrete [`crate::occlusion::OcclusionSystem`]. The
//! trait lives next to its implementer to keep the wide method surface (which references
//! occlusion-internal types like [`HiZBuildRecord`] and [`HiZBuildInput`]) in one place.
