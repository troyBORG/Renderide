//! Interactive desktop/VR selection dialog used by `main.rs` before spawning the Host.
//!
//! This module deliberately lives in the bin target (not in the library) so the bootstrapper
//! lib's unit-test executable never references `rfd`. On Windows, `rfd`'s `common-controls-v6`
//! feature emits a static import of `TaskDialogIndirect` from `comctl32.dll`, which Windows only
//! resolves when the executable carries a Common Controls v6 side-by-side manifest. `build.rs`
//! embeds that manifest into the bootstrapper binary via `embed-manifest`, but `embed-manifest`
//! cannot reach the lib unit-test exe -- so when this code lived in the library, the lib unit-test
//! exe failed to load with `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND` (0xc0000139) on Windows CI. Keeping the
//! `rfd` reference in the bin keeps the lib (and its test exe) free of that import.
